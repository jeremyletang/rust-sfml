/// [`Image`] living on the graphics card that can be used for drawing.
///
/// `RcTexture` stores pixels that can be drawn, with a `RcSprite` for example.
///
/// A texture lives in the graphics card memory, therefore it is very fast to draw a
/// texture to a render target,
/// or copy a render target to a texture (the graphics card can access both directly).
///
/// Being stored in the graphics card memory has some drawbacks.
/// A texture cannot be manipulated as freely as a [`Image`],
/// you need to prepare the pixels first and then upload them to the texture in a
/// single operation (see the various update methods below).
///
/// `RcTexture` makes it easy to convert from/to [`Image`],
/// but keep in mind that these calls require transfers between the graphics card and
/// the central memory, therefore they are slow operations.
///
/// A texture can be loaded from an image, but also directly from a file/memory/stream.
/// The necessary shortcuts are defined so that you don't need an image first for the
/// most common cases.
/// However, if you want to perform some modifications on the pixels before creating the
/// final texture, you can load your file to a [`Image`], do whatever you need with the pixels,
/// and then call [`RcTexture::load_from_image`].
///
/// Since they live in the graphics card memory,
/// the pixels of a texture cannot be accessed without a slow copy first.
/// And they cannot be accessed individually.
/// Therefore, if you need to read the texture's pixels (like for pixel-perfect collisions),
/// it is recommended to store the collision information separately,
/// for example in an array of booleans.
///
/// Like [`Image`], `RcTexture` can handle a unique internal representation of pixels,
/// which is RGBA 32 bits.
/// This means that a pixel must be composed of
/// 8 bits red, green, blue and alpha channels â€“ just like a [`Color`].
