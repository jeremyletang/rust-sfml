/// Trait for all render targets (window, texture, ...)
///
/// `RenderTarget` defines the common behavior of all the 2D render targets usable in
/// the graphics module.
///
/// It makes it possible to draw 2D entities like sprites, shapes, text
/// without using any OpenGL command directly.
///
/// A `RenderTarget` is also able to use views ([`View`]), which are a kind of 2D cameras.
/// With views you can globally scroll, rotate or zoom everything that is drawn,
/// without having to transform every single entity.
/// See the documentation of [`View`] for more details and sample pieces of code about this type.
///
/// On top of that, render targets are still able to render direct OpenGL stuff.
/// It is even possible to mix together OpenGL calls and regular SFML drawing commands.
/// When doing so, make sure that OpenGL states are not messed up by calling the
/// [`push_gl_states`]/[`pop_gl_states`] functions.
