//! Access to the real-time state of the sensors.
//!
//! `sensor` provides an interface to the state of the various sensors that a device provides.
//!
//! This module allows users to query the sensors values at any time and directly, without having
//! to deal with a window and its events. Compared to the `SensorChanged` event, `sensor` can
//! retrieve the state of a sensor at any time (you don't need to store and update its current
//! value on your side).
//!
//! Depending on the OS and hardware of the device (phone, tablet, ...), some sensor types may
//! not be available. You should always check the availability of a sensor before trying to
//! read it, with the `sensor::is_available` function.
//!
//! You may wonder why some sensor types look so similar, for example `Accelerometer` and
//! `Gravity` / `UserAcceleration`. The first one is the raw measurement of the acceleration,
//! and takes into account both the earth gravity and the user movement. The others are more
//! precise: they provide these components separately, which is usually more useful.
//! In fact they are not direct sensors, they are computed internally based on the raw acceleration
//! and other sensors. This is exactly the same for `Gyroscope` vs `Orientation`.
//!
//! Because sensors consume a non-negligible amount of current, they are all disabled by default.
//! You must call `sensor::set_enabled` for each sensor in which you are interested.
//!
//! # Usage example
//!
//! ```
//! use sfml::window::sensor;
//!
//! if sensor::is_available(sensor::Type::Gravity) {
//!     // enable the gravity sensor
//!     sensor::set_enabled(sensor::Type::Gravity, true);
//!     // get the current value of gravity
//!     let _gravity = sensor::get_value(sensor::Type::Gravity);
//! }
//! ```
