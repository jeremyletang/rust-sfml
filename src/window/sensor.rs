//! Access to the real-time state of the sensors.
//!
//! `sensor` provides an interface to the state of the various sensors that a device provides.
//!
//! This module allows users to query the sensors values at any time and directly, without having
//! to deal with a window and its events. Compared to the [`SensorChanged`] event, `sensor` can
//! retrieve the state of a sensor at any time (you don't need to store and update its current
//! value on your side).
//!
//! [`SensorChanged`]: crate::window::Event::SensorChanged
//!
//! Depending on the OS and hardware of the device (phone, tablet, ...), some sensor types may
//! not be available. You should always check the availability of a sensor before trying to
//! read it, with the [`is_available`] function.
//!
//! You may wonder why some sensor types look so similar, for example [`ACCELEROMETER`] and
//! [`GRAVITY`] / [`USER_ACCELERATION`].
//! The first one is the raw measurement of the acceleration,
//! and takes into account both the earth gravity and the user movement. The others are more
//! precise: they provide these components separately, which is usually more useful.
//! In fact they are not direct sensors, they are computed internally based on the raw acceleration
//! and other sensors. This is exactly the same for [`GYROSCOPE`] vs [`ORIENTATION`].
//!
//! Because sensors consume a non-negligible amount of current, they are all disabled by default.
//! You must call [`set_enabled`] for each sensor in which you are interested.
//!
//! # Usage example
//!
//! ```
//! use sfml::window::sensor;
//!
//! if sensor::is_available(sensor::Type::GRAVITY) {
//!     // enable the gravity sensor
//!     sensor::set_enabled(sensor::Type::GRAVITY, true);
//!     // get the current value of gravity
//!     let _gravity = sensor::value(sensor::Type::GRAVITY);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! [`is_available`]: is_available
//! [`set_enabled`]: set_enabled
//! [`ACCELEROMETER`]: Type::ACCELEROMETER
//! [`GRAVITY`]: Type::GRAVITY
//! [`USER_ACCELERATION`]: Type::USER_ACCELERATION
