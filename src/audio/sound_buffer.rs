/// Storage for audio samples defining a sound.
///
/// A sound buffer holds the data of a sound, which is an array of audio samples.
///
/// A sample is a 16 bits signed integer that defines the amplitude of the sound at a given time.
/// The sound is then reconstituted by playing these samples at a high rate
/// (for example, 44100 samples per second is the standard rate used for playing CDs).
/// In short, audio samples are like texture pixels, and a `SoundBuffer` is similar to a `Texture`.
///
/// A sound buffer can be loaded from a file (see `from_file()` for the complete list of
/// supported formats), from memory, from a custom stream or directly from an array of samples.
/// It can also be saved back to a file.
///
/// Sound buffers alone are not very useful: they hold the audio data but cannot be played.
/// To do so, you need to use the sf::Sound class, which provides functions to play/pause/stop
/// the sound as well as changing the way it is outputted (volume, pitch, 3D position, ...).
/// This separation allows more flexibility and better performances: indeed a `SoundBuffer` is
/// a heavy resource, and any operation on it is slow (often too slow for real-time applications).
/// On the other side, a `Sound` is a lightweight object, which can use the audio data of a sound
/// buffer and change the way it is played without actually modifying that data.
/// Note that it is also possible to bind several `Sound` instances to the same `SoundBuffer`.
///
/// It is important to note that the `Sound` instance doesn't copy the buffer that it uses,
/// it only keeps a reference to it. Thus, a `SoundBuffer` can not be destructed while it is
/// borrowed by a `Sound`.
///
/// # Usage example
///
/// ```no_run
/// use sfml::audio::{Sound, SoundBuffer, SoundSource};
///
/// // Load a new sound buffer
/// let buffer = SoundBuffer::from_file("sound.wav").unwrap();
///
/// // Create a sound source and bind it to the buffer
/// let mut sound_1 = Sound::with_buffer(&buffer);
///
/// // Play the sound
/// sound_1.play();
///
/// // Create another sound source bound to the same buffer
/// let mut sound_2 = Sound::with_buffer(&buffer);
///
/// // Play it with a higher pitch -- the first sound remains unchanged
/// sound_2.set_pitch(2.0);
/// sound_2.play();
/// ```
