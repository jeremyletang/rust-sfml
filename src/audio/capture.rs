/// Trait for processing captured sound data.
///
/// `SoundRecorder` provides a simple interface to access the audio recording capabilities
/// of the computer (the microphone).
///
/// As a trait, it only cares about capturing sound samples,
/// the task of making something useful with them is left to the implementer.
/// Note that SFML provides a built-in implementation for saving the captured data to
/// a sound buffer (see [`SoundBufferRecorder`]).
///
/// Only one method is required to be implemented.
///
/// [`on_process_samples`] provides the new chunks of audio samples while the capture happens
/// Moreover, two additional methods can be overridden as well if necessary:
///
/// [`on_start`] is called before the capture happens, to perform custom initializations.
///
/// [`on_stop`] is called after the capture ends, to perform custom cleanup.
///
/// You can also control the frequency of the [`on_process_samples`] calls,
/// with [`SoundRecorderDriver::set_processing_interval`].
/// The default interval is chosen so that recording thread doesn't consume too much CPU,
/// but it can be changed to a smaller value if you need to process the recorded data in real time,
/// for example.
///
/// The audio capture feature may not be supported or activated on every platform,
/// thus it is recommended to check its availability with the [`is_available`] function.
/// If it returns `false`, then any attempt to use an audio recorder will fail.
///
/// If you have multiple sound input devices connected to your computer
/// (for example: microphone, external soundcard, webcam mic, ...)
/// you can get a list of all available devices through the [`available_devices`] function.
/// You can then select a device by calling [`SoundRecorderDriver::set_device`] with the
/// appropriate device. Otherwise the default capturing device will be used.
///
/// By default the recording is in 16-bit mono.
/// Using the [`SoundRecorderDriver::set_channel_count`] method you can change the number of
/// channels used by the audio capture device to record.
/// Note that you have to decide whether you want to record in mono or stereo before
/// starting the recording.
///
/// It is important to note that the audio capture happens in a separate thread,
/// so that it doesn't block the rest of the program. In particular,
/// the [`on_process_samples`] function (but not [`on_start`] and not [`on_stop`])
/// will be called from this separate thread.
/// It is important to keep this in mind, because you may have to take care of
/// synchronization issues if you share data between threads.
