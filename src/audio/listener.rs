//! The audio listener is the point in the scene from where all the sounds are heard.
//!
//! The audio listener defines the global properties of the audio environment,
//! it defines where and how sounds and musics are heard.
//!
//! If `View` is the eyes of the user, then `listener` is his ears (by the way, they are often
//! linked together â€“ same position, orientation, etc.).
//!
//! `listener` is a simple interface, which allows to setup the listener in the 3D audio environment
//! (position, direction and up vector), and to adjust the global volume.
//!
//! # Usage example
//!
//! ```
//! use sfml::audio::listener;
//!
//! // Move the listener to the position (1, 0, -5)
//! listener::set_position3f(1., 0., -5.);
//!
//! // Make it face the right axis (1, 0, 0)
//! listener::set_direction3f(1., 0., 0.);
//!
//! // Reduce the global volume
//! listener::set_global_volume(50.);
//! ```
