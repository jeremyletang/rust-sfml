/// Streamed music played from an audio file.
///
/// `Music`s are sounds that are streamed rather than completely loaded in memory.
///
/// This is especially useful for compressed musics that usually take hundreds of MB when they are
/// uncompressed: by streaming it instead of loading it entirely, you avoid saturating the memory
/// and have almost no loading delay. This implies that the underlying resource
/// (file, stream or memory buffer) must remain valid for the lifetime of the `Music` object.
///
/// Apart from that, a `Music` has almost the same features as the
/// [`SoundBuffer`] / [`Sound`] pair: you can play/pause/stop it, request its parameters
/// (channels, sample rate), change the way it is played (pitch, volume, 3D position, ...), etc.
///
/// As a sound stream, a music is played in its own thread in order not to block the rest of the
/// program. This means that you can leave the music alone after calling [`play`],
/// it will manage itself very well.
///
/// # Usage example
///
/// ```no_run
/// use sfml::audio::{Music, SoundSource};
///
/// // Open a new music from an audio file
/// let mut music = Music::from_file("music.ogg").unwrap();
///
/// // Change some parameters
/// music.set_position((0., 1., 10.)); // change its 3D position
/// music.set_pitch(2.); // increase the pitch
/// music.set_volume(50.); // reduce the volume
/// music.set_looping(true); // make it loop
///
/// // Play it
/// music.play();
/// ```
