//! # rust-sfml
//!
//! __SFML__ bindings for Rust
//!
//! This is a Rust binding for __SFML__, the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library,
//! developped by Laurent Gomila.
//!
//! __SFML__ website : www.sfml-dev.org
//!
//!
//! You must install on your computer the SFML2 and CSFML2 libraries
//! who are used for the binding.
//!
//! SFML2: http://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.0/
//!
//! CSFML2: http://www.sfml-dev.org/download/csfml/
//!
//! Then clone the repo and build the library with the following command.
//!
//! __Rust-sfml__ is now build with make :
//!
//! ```Shell
//! > make
//! ```
//!
//! This command build rust-sfml, the examples, and the documentation.
//!
//! You can build them separatly too.
//!
//! ```Shell
//! > make lib
//! > make examples
//! > make doc
//! ```
//!
//! __Rust-sfml__ works on Linux, windows and OSX.
//!
//! # Short example
//!
//! Here is a short example, draw a circle shape and display it.
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate rsfml;
//!
//! use rsfml::system::Vector2f;
//! use rsfml::window::{ContextSettings, VideoMode, event, Close};
//! use rsfml::graphics::{RenderWindow, RenderTarget, CircleShape, Color};
//!
//! fn main () -> () {
//!     // Create the window of the application
//!     let mut window = match RenderWindow::new(VideoMode::new_init(800, 600, 32),
//!                                              "SFML Example",
//!                                              Close,
//!                                              &ContextSettings::default()) {
//!         Some(window) => window,
//!         None => panic!("Cannot create a new Render Window.")
//!     };
//!
//!     // Create a CircleShape
//!     let mut circle = match CircleShape::new() {
//!         Some(circle) => circle,
//!         None       => panic!("Error, cannot create ball")
//!     };
//!     circle.set_radius(30.);
//!     circle.set_fill_color(&Color::red());
//!     circle.set_position(&Vector2f::new(100., 100.));
//!
//!     while window.is_open() {
//!         // Handle events
//!         for event in window.events() {
//!             match event {
//!                 event::Closed => window.close(),
//!                 _             => {/* do nothing */}
//!             }
//!         }
//!
//!         // Clear the window
//!         window.clear(&Color::new_RGB(0, 200, 200));
//!         // Draw the shape
//!         window.draw(&circle);
//!         // Display things on screen
//!         window.display()
//!     }
//! }
