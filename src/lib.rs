//! Rust bindings for [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org), the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library.
//!
//! Prerequisites
//! =============
//!
//! - Rust 1.42 or later
//!
//! - SFML 2.5 and CSFML 2.5 must be installed on your computer. You can download them here:
//!
//!     - SFML 2.5: <http://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php>
//!     - CSFML 2.5: <http://www.sfml-dev.org/download/csfml/>
//!
//! - Supported platforms:
//!     - Linux
//!     - Windows
//!     - Mac OS X
//!
//! # !! Thread safety warning !!
//!
//! rust-sfml strives to be memory-safe, as a Rust library should be, but currently there is no
//! clear plan on how to solve thread-safety issues. You should be fine as long as you only use
//! SFML on the main thread, but as soon as you try to call into SFML from another thread, you
//! are on your own.
//!
//! # License
//!
//! This software is a binding of the SFML library created by Laurent Gomila, which
//! is provided under the Zlib/png license.
//!
//! This software is provided under the same license than the SFML, the Zlib/png
//! license.
