/// Blending modes for drawing.
///
/// `BlendMode` is a type that represents a blend mode.
///
/// A blend mode determines how the colors of an object you draw are mixed with the colors that
/// are already in the buffer.
///
/// The type is composed of 6 components, each of which has its own public field:
///
/// - Color Source Factor (`color_src_factor`)
/// - Color Destination Factor (`color_dst_factor`)
/// - Color Blend Equation (`color_equation`)
/// - Alpha Source Factor (`alpha_src_factor`)
/// - Alpha Destination Factor (`alpha_dst_factor`)
/// - Alpha Blend Equation (`alpha_equation`)
///
/// The source factor specifies how the pixel you are drawing contributes to the final color.
/// The destination factor specifies how the pixel already drawn in the buffer contributes to
/// the final color.
///
/// The color channels RGB (red, green, blue; simply referred to as color) and A
/// (alpha; the transparency) can be treated separately. This separation can be useful for
/// specific blend modes, but most often you won't need it and will simply treat the color as
/// a single unit.
///
/// The blend factors and equations correspond to their OpenGL equivalents.
/// In general, the color of the resulting pixel is calculated according to the following
/// formula (src is the color of the source pixel, dst the color of the destination pixel,
/// the other variables correspond to the public members, with the equations
/// being + or - operators):
///
/// ```ignore
/// dst.rgb = color_src_factor * src.rgb (color_equation) color_dst_factor * dst.rgb
/// dst.a   = alpha_src_factor * src.a   (alpha_equation) alpha_dst_factor * dst.a
/// ```
///
/// All factors and colors are represented as floating point numbers between 0 and 1.
/// Where necessary, the result is clamped to fit in that range.
///
/// In SFML, a blend mode can be specified every time you draw a `Drawable` object to
/// a render target. It is part of the `RenderStates` compound that is passed to
/// `RenderTarget::draw()`.
