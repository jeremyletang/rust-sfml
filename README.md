=========

Rust bindings for [SFML](http://www.sfml-dev.org), the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library.

Requirements
=============

- Linux, Windows, or OS X
- Rust 1.66 or later
- [SFML 2.5](http://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php)
- A C++ compiler for building CSFML

Environment variables
=============
If you get errors about SFML headers not being found, or linker errors, that probably means
SFML is not installed in a global location.
In that case, you can set two environment variables to help rust-sfml find the required files:
- `SFML_INCLUDE_DIR`. Set this to the `include` folder of your SFML location.
- `SFML_LIBS_DIR`. Set this to the `lib` folder of your SFML location.

To help debugging environment variables, you can try building with `cargo build -vv`.
If the environment variables are set correctly, you should get warnings like this:

```
warning: Custom SFML include dir: C:\Users\You\sfml\include
warning: Adding custom SFML libs search path C:\Users\You\sfml\lib
```

Documentation
=====
The API documentation is available at: https://docs.rs/sfml/
